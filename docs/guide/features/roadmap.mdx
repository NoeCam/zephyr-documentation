# Roadmap
While no roadmap is set in stone we are doing our best to share our public roadmap to the extent that we can.

## Alpha 1
Target Launch Date: April 1, 2024: *not a joke*
### Cloud Support
Zephyr Cloud Built in cloud support only
### Goals
The goal of this phase is to prove our ability to onboard our initial burst of users to begin their proof of concepts.
This is also including content creators and developer relations folks. While it does not achieve our goal of bring your own cloud
it does conceptually prove the values that Zephyr Cloud is working as advertised.

## Alpha 2
Target Launch Date: April 22, 2024
### Cloud Support
Cloudflare, AWS
### Goals
As more complex proof of concepts land we will be adding the Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) functionality. This is a requirement for
many organizations and key to our desired developer experience.

## Alpha 3
Target Launch Date: May 6, 2024
### Cloud Support
Netlify, Vercel
### Goals
Additional goals beyond adding further cloud support TBD

## Alpha 4
Target Launch Date: May 20, 2024
### Cloud Support
GCP, Azure, Self Hosted Cloud (Unmanaged)
### Goals
Additional goals beyond adding further cloud support TBD
