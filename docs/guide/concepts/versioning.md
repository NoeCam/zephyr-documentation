# Versioning

Zephyr leverages familiar concepts rather than reinventing the wheel. Accordingly, we have adopted [SemVer](https://semver.org/) as our versioning methodology.

## Calculating Versions

### Application Name

- Derived from the `name` field in `package.json`.

### Versions

- Based on the `version` in `package.json`.
- Includes the current branch name.
- Incorporates a formatted username.

## Updating Tags

Updates to tags are managed systematically to reflect changes in versions and ensure traceability.
