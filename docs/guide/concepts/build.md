# Build with Zephyr
One of the initial design goals of Zephyr Cloud was to make it possible to incrementally adopt. When you first install the
Zephyr package it will operate in an "observe" only mode. Without changing your CI/CD pipeline or extensive configuration
Zephyr will begin to build the graph of your federated applications. 

:::tip
When first getting started Zephyr Cloud is a side effect of your build.
