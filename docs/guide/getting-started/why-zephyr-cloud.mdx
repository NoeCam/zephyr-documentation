# Why Zephyr Cloud

[//]: # (We need to create a video for this part of the docs)

We created Zephyr Cloud because as developers and consultants we kept getting the same questions from customers, "How do
we deploy federated applications." and "What are the best practices for developing and deploying micro-frontends".

Zephyr is actually our second iteration of trying to solve this problem. The first iteration was a platform called
[Medusa](https://medusa.codes/).

As we started to build out Zephyr Cloud we discovered that we were actually solving productivity issues for all sites,
not just for federated applications.

## How Does Zephyr Help You?
Zephyr helps to: **speed up your software development lifecycle** (e.g. local development, CI/CD, QA Testing, Deployment),
**increase collaboration** and **increase iteration speed**.

You can use Zephyr to:
* Deploy to your existing public cloud account faster
* Version your frontend
* Gain visibility into how your micro-frontends are connected
