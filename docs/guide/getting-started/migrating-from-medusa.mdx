# Migrating from Medusa
[Medusa](https://medusa.codes/) was the first iteration Zephyr Cloud. When we created Medusa we believed that one of the biggest
things needed in a distributed frontend environment was observability. As users began to provide us with feedback on Medusa
we found that some of the biggest problems working in federated environments was actually the developer experience and devops complexities.

We created Zephyr Cloud to look at the entire distributed software development lifecycle.
