# Installation

## Quick Start Examples
For new applications we have two quick examples that can be used for getting started.
* [create mf app](/guide/getting-started/create-mf-app)
* [nx generated app](/guide/getting-started/nx-mf-app)

## Adding Zephyr to an existing application
When we started Zephyr Cloud we wanted it to be incredibly easy to get started.

### Add Zephyr as a dependency
Add the package from NPM.
```sh filename="Terminal"
npm i zephyr-webpack-plugin --save
```

### Setting Up
Wrap your existing configuration

  For Nx projects that are using compose plugins adding Zephyr is as easy as adding one more plugin.
  Zephyr must be the last plugin in the compose in order to work as expected.
    ```diff filename="webpack.config.js"
    + const {withZephyr} = require('zephyr-webpack-plugin');
    export default composePlugins(
        withNx(),
        withReact(),
        withModuleFederation(config),
    +   withZephyr(),
        (config)=>{
        return config;
      }
    );
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab>
  You will need to modify the webpack or rspack configuration for your project and add to your existing
  configuration the `withZephyr` function.

      ```diff filename="webpack.config.js"
      - module.exports = {/* the existing config object */};
      + const {withZephyr} = require('zephyr-webpack-plugin');
      + module.exports = withZephyr()({/* the existing config object */});
      ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Build the application
When you build your application Zephyr will open your browser and ask you to log in.

You're now ready to develop with Zephyr.
